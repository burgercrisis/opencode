## Philosophy

| Principle                       | What It Means                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GPT / Claude / Gemini First** | We explicitly focus on these three providers. Others may work (synced from upstream) but are not actively maintained.      |
| **TUI First**                   | Only the Terminal UI is actively maintained. SDK, API endpoints, Desktop App, etc. may have issues — use at your own risk. |
| **Flexibility**                 | Configurable agents, models, permissions, prompts — everything bends to your workflow.                                     |
| **Power First**                 | Advanced features for power users who demand full control.                                                                 |

| **TUI**       | ✅ Actively maintained                  |
| SDK           | ⚠️ Synced from upstream, not maintained |
| API Endpoints | ⚠️ Synced from upstream, not maintained |
| Desktop App   | ⚠️ Synced from upstream, not maintained |
| Web Console   | ⚠️ Synced from upstream, not maintained |

| Provider                | Status                                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **OpenAI (GPT, Codex)** | ✅ Actively maintained                  |

| **Google (Gemini)**     | ✅ Actively maintained                  |
| Others                  | ⚠️ Synced from upstream, not maintained |

## Key Features

### 1. Async Subagent System

The flagship feature. A complete rework of agent orchestration:

- **Nested sessions** — Spawn subagents that can spawn their own subagents
- **True async execution** — Multiple agents run in parallel, not sequentially
- **Inter-agent messaging** — Agents communicate via `send_agent_message` / `wait_agent_message`
- **Flexible patterns** — Fire-and-wait, streaming updates, fire-and-forget

```
Primary Session
 ├─ Subagent A (exploring)
 │   └─ Sub-subagent A1 (deep dive)
 └─ Subagent B (testing)
```

**New tools:**

| Tool                 | Purpose                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `subagent_spawn`     | Spawn subagents with custom prompts               |
| `send_agent_message` | Send messages to other sessions                   |
| `wait_agent_message` | Wait for responses (`all` / `any` mode + timeout) |

---

### 2. GPT/Codex Session Cache Fix

The most critical optimization: **`x-session-id` header for OpenAI requests**.

```typescript
// Enables OpenAI's server-side prompt caching
headers: {
  "x-session-id": sessionID.replace(/^ses_/, "sess_"),
}
```

This allows OpenAI to cache prompts across requests within the same session, significantly reducing:

- **Token costs** — Cached tokens are cheaper
- **Latency** — Cached prompts process faster

Additional optimizations:

- **Stable tool ordering** — Tools sorted deterministically to maximize cache reuse
- **Environment caching** — System environment pinned during active sessions
- **Cache stats in TUI** — Monitor hit percentage in the sidebar

---

### 3. Enhanced TUI Experience

- **Nested session navigation** — Visual tree view of all spawned agents
- **Session state indicators** — See which agents are working / waiting / done
- **Click-to-jump** — Click subsession references to navigate directly
- **Subagent session picker** — Browse and switch between sessions in the hierarchy
- **Paste collapse/expand** — Toggle large pasted content between collapsed and expanded view

---

### 4. Error Handling & Recovery

- **Orphan thinking handling** — Interrupted runs can leave an assistant turn with only thinking and no final output. We keep that thinking in the local transcript, but omit it from the next model prompt (to avoid providers rejecting empty messages) and clearly mark it in the UI/transcript export.
  - **Why:** some providers (eg, Claude) require every message to be non-empty; unsupported thinking/reasoning parts may be dropped by adapters, turning a thinking-only assistant turn into an empty message and failing the request.
- **Hardened crash recovery** — Better handling of interrupted sessions and missing tool results
- **Trash recovery fixes** — Improved resilience for corrupted session state

---

### 5. Provider Fixes

| Provider               | Fix                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **OpenAI (GPT/Codex)** | Session ID header for caching, orphan reasoning sanitization |
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | Tool ID normalization, cache control                         |
| **Google (Gemini)**    | Temperature/topP defaults                                    |

2. `$XDG_BIN_DIR` - XDG Base Directory Specification compliant path
3. `$HOME/bin` - Standard user binary directory (if exists or can be created)
4. `$HOME/.opencode/bin` - Default fallback

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Clouder0/overcode.git
cd overcode
bun install

# Build for current platform
cd packages/opencode
bun run build --single

# Binary will be at dist/opencode-<os>-<arch>/bin/opencode
# Copy to your PATH, e.g.:
cp dist/opencode-linux-x64/bin/opencode ~/.local/bin/
# or
cp dist/opencode-darwin-arm64/bin/opencode ~/.local/bin/
```

### Configuration

## Relationship to Upstream

This is a **personal fork** with significant divergence from [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode).

- **Does not track upstream directly** — Cherry-picks specific bug fixes and security patches
- **Narrow maintenance scope** — TUI + GPT/Claude/Gemini only
- **Different architecture** — Nested session model with async subagents
